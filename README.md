## Theoratical music library APP

The idea behind this app is to create a theoratical music library app with the following instructions below.

   # SQL: Query to return music tracks from a music library database. 
        - Must return data from more than one table that are linked by a relationship. 
        - Must include at least the track artist, title, genre, and duration. 
        - Must only return tracks from the last year. 
        - Must be in the order of artist and title ascending. 
   # C#: Music Library 
        - Must have a method named: GetMusicTracks to return a list of tracks for a given genre. 
        - Must validate for zero duration tracks and prevent from being returned. 
        - Provide an example of the use of an interface to fetch tracks data. 
   # C#: Music Library Tests 
        - Test that GetMusicTracks returns at least one track or more. 
        - Test that GetMusicTracks returns tracks with matching genre. 
        - Test that GetMusicTracks returns no tracks with zero duration. 
   # Web Page: Music Library View 
        - Display a list of music tracks. 
        - Must include HTML.
